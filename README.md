This repository contains coding problems and suggested exercises from the book
'cracking the coding interview'.

src/ the solutions
test/ contains the automated tests for all the files in src

Because java is a language that many shops will let you use as the language
of choice for the interview, that is the language used for this project.


Ruby's Guard is used to execute the automated tests in a continuous fashion,
and rake is used to build the java files every time.
